# Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This project showcases my professional work, skills, and achievements. It's designed to be responsive, accessible, and user-friendly.

## Project Overview

The website is structured into several key sections, each crafted to illustrate my professional narrative and to resonate with the Hero archetype, symbolizing a journey of courage, perseverance, and growth.

- **Hero Section**: The welcoming space setting the tone for the journey ahead.
- **About Section**: A deeper dive into my professional background, aligning with the Hero archetype's narrative of growth and development.
- **Skills Section**: Displaying my arsenal of tools and skills, reflective of the Hero's capabilities.
- **Experience Section**: A chronicle of my professional quests and milestones.
- **Education Section**: Detailing the learning and knowledge I've amassed on my journey.
- **Publications Section**: Scholarly articles and research showcasing my contributions to the field.
- **Achievements Section**: A testament to the victories and recognitions earned along the way.
- **Hero Archetype**: An explanation of how the Hero archetype influences my work ethic and professional endeavors.

## Hero Archetype

The Hero archetype is central to the thematic construction of this portfolio. This section elaborates on how the Hero's qualities are woven into the fabric of my professional identity:

- **Resilience and Determination**: Narratives and case studies demonstrating problem-solving under pressure, learning from failures, and persistently moving towards goals.
- **Leadership and Growth**: Highlighting instances of leadership, mentorship, and the impact made on teams and projects.
- **Adventurous Spirit**: Illustrating innovative projects and ventures that pushed boundaries and introduced new ideas.

By aligning the portfolio's narrative with the Hero archetype, the intent is to present a journey that not only outlines a list of achievements but also tells a story of continual growth and the overcoming of challenges.

## Development

The website is developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It employs a responsive design to ensure it looks great on all devices. The `Playwright` testing framework is used to write automated tests to verify the functionality of each section.

### GitHub Actions

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Upon each push or pull request, Playwright tests are run to ensure that updates do not break any functionality.

## Accessibility

Accessibility is a priority, and the site aims to be compliant with WCAG standards. Regular audits are conducted to identify and fix accessibility issues.
